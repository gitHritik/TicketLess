  "description": "Here the language of stone surpasses the language of man says Rabindranath Tagore, about the iconic Sun Temple at Konark. A UNESCO World Heritage Site, this splendid structure, which is designed as the cosmic chariot of the SunGod, is one of India's signature buildings.This 13th century marvel was constructed by the Odishan king Narashimhadev I, to celebrate his victory. Its 24cartwheels (epitomizing the hours of the day) are decorated with symbolic designs and is led by a team of sevenhorses (personifying days of the week). The entire temple structure, which is a perfect blend of Dravidian and Orissanstyles of architecture, is full of exquisite stone carvings.The Sun Temple is designed in a way that the dawn would illuminate the temple sanctuary. The images of Sun God atthree sides of the structure are positioned to catch the sunrays at morning, noon and evening. The Sun Temple in Konark is an amalgam of legends, culture and ancient architectural excellence.",
